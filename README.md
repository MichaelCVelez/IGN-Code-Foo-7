# IGN-Code-Foo-7

Hello IGN Team! Here is my source code repository for all of the Code Foo problems which can be found at 
http://www.ign.com/code-foo/2017/

For details on my thought process, screenshots and demonstrations of the compiled code please see the Powerpoint presentation I attached to my application email.

Thank you!
